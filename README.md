## **Application introduction**
Using unsupervised learning to analyze data on the cryptocurrencies traded on the market. Implementing machine learning models to report what cryptocurrencies are trading on the  market and how they could be grouped. Creating a classification for developing a potential new investment product.



## **Steps**
Prepared the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
Reduced data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
Predicted clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
Created some plots and data tables to present the clustering results.
